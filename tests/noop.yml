# noop playbook used by Vagrantfile to auto generate inventory file. We call it noop
# because idealy it would do nothing, but it is currently adding a variable to the
# inventory in case we have users not yet running vagrant 1.8.0.

# It is possible to set ansible_ssh_user with ansible but it requires vagrant 1.8.0
# https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/ansible_intro.html
# so for now we run a play in here.

# We only have a single host group, but we limit the inventory to just the host that
# just got provisioned when we run this playbook.
