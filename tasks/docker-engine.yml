# Install docker engine.
#
# This is one of at least two mechanisms for installing Docker via apt (the other
# being the `lxc-docker` package). There is currently only one version of `docker-engine`
# available, so this mechanism will only work for the most recent `docker_version`,
# currently `1.8.1`.
#
# Installing this docker will remove the lxc-docker package.

# The package version for docker-engine looks something like this:
#
#   1.11.2-0~trusty
#
# The part before the dash is the Docker version. The "0" here is the "debian revision"
# - that's there to allow the package builder to give you a new version of the package
# even if the packaged software hasn't changed. For packages that use "debian revision",
# the convention is to start with "-1"; "-0" generally means "we are opting out of this
# debian revision stuff". All of the packages available in the docker repo have
# revision "-0". That said, it *could* be set to something non-zero at some point in the
# future. So, use a wildcard instead of 0 when specifying the path. Apt will search and,
# if there are multiple matches, install the matching package with the highest version.
# i.e. if there's a -0 and a -1 we'll get -1.
